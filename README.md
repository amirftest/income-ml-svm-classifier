# income-ml-svm-classifier

## Implementation Details
  
#### SVM_handler
 * For training the svm machine, i used SCV(C-Support Vector Classification),  and applied the SelectKBest - feature selection algorithm, to minimize the error percentage.
 * training/testing status var was created to handle multi-thread environment and preventing unnecessary repeated job.
  
#### GUI
  * I've used tkinter for making the gui and messagebox to alert the user. In order to make the gui responsive, for each task a new thread will be created.
   * To handle Cuncurrency issues, a boolean var will be checked to see if some task already been done / in process.
